1. I would like to use one late day for this project.

2. I would like to acknowledge the following references that helped me with this project.

	a. https://bradfieldcs.com/algos/graphs/dijkstras-algorithm/
	b. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVfj6mxhdMw
	c. https://docs.python.org/2/library/heapq.html 

3. I'm pretty sure one of the big reasons why my code is slow is because of the for loop looping
through all neighbors for every node. Since i've already taken a late day on this assignment, I will
try to speed this up by vectorizing the code later.
